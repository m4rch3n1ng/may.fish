# may fish prompt

a simple and fast prompt for fish shells, made by me, [may](https://github.com/m4rch3n1ng).  
comes with git integration.

## install

```sh
$ fisher install m4rch3n1ng/may.fish
```

## info

this is a port from my previously made [oh-my-zsh prompt](https://github.com/m4rch3n1ng/dotfiles/tree/main/arch/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/may.zsh-theme)
